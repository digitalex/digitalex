## Hi there 👋

You've stumbled upon the README of a software engineer who's currently wrangling code for Jules at Google Labs! 🤖 When I'm not tinkering with bits and bytes, you might find me shredding some tunes on my guitar 🎸.

I'm currently soaking up the California sun in the San Francisco Bay Area, though my Viking roots trace back to Norway! 🇳🇴 So, whether it's coding, music, or just chatting about the fjords, feel free to reach out!
